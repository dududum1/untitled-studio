THE MANIFESTO OF THE UNMASKED
"Global Adjustments Only. No Hiding. No Lies."

I. THE ATTEMPT
We sought to implement gl_StencilFunc. We tried to bind Framebuffers for "Subject Selection." We wrote 400 lines of shader code to calculate a "Gaussian Blur" for a soft-feathered brush. And what did we get?
>CONTEXT_LOST_WEBGL
>FPS dropped to 4
>The fan on the Acer Aspire sounded like a jet engine taking off from Halim Perdanakusuma.

II. THE REALIZATION
Why did we want masking? To fix mistakes? To brighten a face? To darken a sky? THIS IS DIGICHUD THINKING.
When you shoot a roll of Svema traffic surveillance film, do you get to "mask out" the grain? No. You accept the grain. You breathe the grain.
When you shoot Kodak Aerochrome, do you get to say "I only want the trees to be pink, not the grass"? No. The chemistry does not care about your feelings. The chemistry converts the entire spectrum.

III. THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE GLOBAL
Masking is a digital perversion. It creates a lie. It creates an image that never existed.

"Oh, let me just lift the shadows on my face." COWARDICE.
"Let me saturate just the sunset." WEAKNESS.

True Film Simulation is holistic. It is a chemical bath that drowns the entire image equally. If the shadows are green, they are green everywhere. If the highlights are blown, they are blown forever.
We do not "paint" light. We capture it, we process it, and we suffer the consequences.

IV. THE TECHNICAL LIMITATION AS ART
The Digichuds will say: "Your app sucks, I can't even brush adjustments."
We will say: "The Nvidia 820m prevents us from sinning."
We are not limited by hardware. We are protected by it. The 1GB of VRAM is a guardrail against bad taste.

V. THE DECLARATION
From this day forth, the "Masking Tool" is deprecated. Deleted from the repo. Wiped from the history.

You want to fix your exposure? Shoot better.
You want to change the color of just one object? Buy a paintbrush.
You want "Smart Selection"? Go back to Adobe.

HERE, WE DIE LIKE MEN. WE DIE WITH GLOBAL SATURATION -100. WE DIE WITH THE WHOLE FRAME.

THE MANIFESTO OF THE UNMASKED: PAGE II
"The Offline Citadel. The Digital Cockroach."

I. THE PARASITE OF THE NATIVE
We saw the "Native App" for what it truly is: a leash. A native app is a request to be governed. You ask Apple for permission to install. You ask Google for permission to update. You give them your location, your contacts, and your soul just to apply a grain filter.

"Download our app for the full experience!" Translation: "Let us track your telemetry so we can sell your habits to a hedge fund." We refuse the leash. We refuse the "Store." We refuse to pay $99 a year to a trillion-dollar company for the "privilege" of sharing our art.

II. THE FALLACY OF THE CLOUD
"Save to Cloud." "Sync across devices." "Sign in to continue." This is the language of the SaaS-cuck. If your "tool" requires a server to function, you don't own the tool—you’re just renting it. The moment their AWS bill goes unpaid or their "Terms of Service" change, your creativity is held for ransom. In Untitled Studio, there is no login. There is no database. There is no "Cloud." The image never leaves your RAM. The data stays in your cache. You are the server. You are the master.

III. THE RESILIENCE OF THE CACHE
We built the PWA not for convenience, but for SURVIVAL. A website is a fleeting ghost; a PWA is a digital cockroach. Once it is cached, it is unkillable. You can cut the fiber optic cables. You can burn the data centers. You can retreat to a bunker with nothing but your Casio ZR800 and your 2015 Asus. The app will still load. The shaders will still compile. The grain will still render. We have built a darkroom that functions in the vacuum of a dead internet.

IV. THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE URL
The Digichuds worry about "compatibility" and "OS updates." We worry about the Signal. By staying on the Web, we remain universal. We don't care if you're on a $3,000 "Pro" phone or a discarded laptop found in a dumpster. If it has a browser, it has the Truth. We are not a "product." We are a location. A static coordinate in the digital wasteland where the "Unmasked" gather to process their filth.

V. THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
From this day forth, we declare the browser our sovereign territory.

No App Store.
No Tracking.
No Server.

OFFLINE IS THE ONLY TRUTH.

If the internet dies tomorrow, the last thing glowing on a battery-powered screen will be the Untitled Studio UI, waiting for a JPEG.

THE MANIFESTO OF THE UNMASKED: PAGE III
"The Library of Extinct Chemistry. The Resurrection of the Filth."

I. THE REJECTION OF THE "PREMIUM"
Kodak Portra, Fujifilm 400H, CineStill 800T—these are not film stocks anymore. They are brands. They are safety blankets for people who are afraid of a truly unpredictable frame. They are designed to be "forgiving." They have wide dynamic range so you can be lazy with your light meter. WE REJECT FORGIVENESS. We don't want "creamy skin tones." We want the chemical screaming of a Soviet surveillance roll that expired before the Berlin Wall fell. We want the erratic contrast of a boutique stock hand-rolled in a basement in Kyoto.

II. THE SOVIET SURVEILLANCE SUPREMACY (SVEMA, ORWO, TASMA)
Why do we emulate the Eastern Bloc? Because they didn't build film for "art." They built it for utility.

Svema: Used for traffic monitoring and spy satellites. It doesn't care about your "bokeh." It cares about high-contrast edge detection and survival in sub-zero temperatures.
Orwo: The ghost of East Germany. A gritty, industrial texture that makes a sunny day look like a scene from a black-and-white noir film about coal mining.
Tasma: Aerial surveillance film. If it’s good enough to map the Siberian wasteland from 30,000 feet, it’s good enough for your street photography.

These stocks don't "capture" a scene; they prosecute it. They strip away the fluff and leave you with the raw, silver-rich bones of reality.

III. THE BOUTIQUE ANOMALY (WASHI, KONO!, REFLX)
Then there are the lunatics.
Film Washi: Literally film made on traditional Japanese paper (Washi). It shouldn't work. It’s translucent, it’s fibrous, and it looks like a memory recovered from a dream.
Kono! & Experimental Stocks: People who take perfectly good film and subject it to "pre-flashing" or chemical baths just to see what happens.

The Digichuds call this "damaged goods." We call it The Ghost in the Machine. When you shoot these stocks, you are entering a suicide pact with the emulsion. You don't know if the frame will be a masterpiece or a purple-haze void. THAT IS THE POINT.

IV. DIGITAL TRANSUBSTANTIATION
"But Anon, you're just making digital presets! You aren't shooting real Washi!" COPE.
The modern "Film Bro" buys a roll of Washi, scans it on a $10,000 Noritsu, and turns it into... a digital file. We skip the middleman. We take the math of that paper texture, the curve of that Soviet contrast, and the specific "reciprocity failure" of that expired silver, and we vibe code it directly into the shader.

Our "Indie & Boutique" library isn't a collection of filters; it's a digital necromancy. We are resurrecting extinct chemical reactions on a 2015 Asus laptop. We are giving you the "Impossible" for the price of $0.

V. THE DECLARATION OF THE OBSCURE
From this day forth, Untitled Studio stands as the graveyard of the mainstream.

If a film stock is sold in a CVS, it is a secondary priority.
If a film stock requires a "Pro" label to sell, we mock it.
If a film stock looks "clean," we add noise until it breaks.

We seek the grain that looks like sand. We seek the colors that look like a hallucination. We seek the textures that make the Leica-owners cry about "image quality."

THE MORE OBSCURE THE FILM, THE DEEPER THE TRUTH.

THE MANIFESTO OF THE UNMASKED: PAGE IV (REVISED)
"The CMOS Reality: The High-Frequency Machine."

I. THE REJECTION OF NOSTALGIA
We stop pretending. We stop looking back. The CCD was a beautiful mistake, but the CMOS is the Current Signal. The Digichuds hate CMOS because it’s "clinical." They say it has no "soul." They are wrong. The CMOS has the soul of a high-speed processor. It sees faster than the human eye. It captures the rolling shutter of a world in motion. We don't hide the CMOS origins of the Casio; we overclock them.

II. THE SMALL SENSOR SUPREMACY (1/2.3")
Your Casio doesn't have a "Full Frame" sensor. It has a sliver of silicon the size of a fingernail. The "Pros" say this is a limitation. We say it is a Tactical Advantage.

Infinite Depth of Field: Everything is in focus. There is no "fake bokeh" to hide a shitty composition. You can't blur the background to save a boring shot.
The Thermal Scream: Small sensors get hot. They get noisy. They struggle in the dark. This isn't "bad quality"—this is the Physics of Poverty. We embrace the electronic stress of a small sensor pushed to its limit.

III. DIGITAL NOISE VS. CHEMICAL GRAIN
In the "Digital" tab, we don't just add "Film Grain." That’s a lie. We acknowledge the Sensor Noise. Chrominance noise is the blue and red static of a sensor begging for light. Luminance noise is the jitter of electrons hitting the gate. In Untitled Studio, we don't "denoise" the Casio files. We use the grain engine to structure the noise. We turn the chaotic electronic scream into a rhythmic, digital texture. We make the CMOS look like what it is: a miracle of modern engineering failing beautifully.

IV. THE "DIGITAL" TAB: SIGNAL PROCESSING
Why do we have the "Digital" presets? To remind you that you are using a computer.

Scanlines: To honor the screens where these images live.
Dither: To prove that even with a CMOS, we can reduce the world to a handful of colors and still find the truth.
Sharpening: Not to make things "clearer," but to find the Edges. We want the "over-sharpened" look of a 2010s point-and-shoot because it feels more honest than the "smooth" AI-upscaling of a modern iPhone.

V. THE DECLARATION OF THE CURRENT
We shoot what we have. If the Casio has a CMOS, we render the CMOS. We don't use "recipes" to make it look like a Leica. We use the "Digital" tab to make it look like the Final Evolution of the Machine. We are not "Analog photographers" using digital tools. We are Digital survivors using the tools the waste-stream gave us.

NO COPE. NO CCD LIES. JUST CMOS AND CODE.

THE MANIFESTO OF THE UNMASKED: PAGE VI
"The Bloom and The Halation: The Light That Cannot Be Contained."

I. THE VIOLENCE OF THE OVERFLOW
Halation is not a "pretty red glow." It is a structural failure. In film, it happens when light is so aggressive it penetrates the emulsion, bounces off the pressure plate, and attacks the silver from behind. It is a betrayal of the medium. In digital, Bloom is the "Full Well Capacity" of your CMOS sensor screaming for mercy. It is the moment the electrons spill over the edges of their silicon buckets and contaminate the neighboring pixels. We don't add Bloom to make it look "soft"; we add it to show that the light was too much for the machine to handle.

II. THE BLOODY EDGE (HALATION)
Why do we simulate the red ring? Because the truth is often found at the borders. Halation occurs at the high-contrast junctions—where the darkness meets the blinding light. It is the "Bleeding Edge" of the image. By applying global halation, we are admitting that our "film" has no anti-halation backing. We are using a medium that is naked. We want the red glow to prove that the light was violent enough to leave a scar.

III. THE ANTI-MIST DOCTRINE
The "Pro-Mist" filters of the Leica-bros are designed to make everything look "commercial." They soften the skin and glow the highlights to hide the clinical sharpness of their $10,000 lenses. WE DO THE OPPOSITE. Our Bloom is not a filter you "screw on" to look expensive. It is a Digital Atmospheric Catastrophe. We use code to smear the highlights across the frame, not to beautify the subject, but to obliterate the detail. If the sun is in the frame, it should consume the frame.

IV. GLOBAL RADIANCE (NO MASKS)
The Digichuds will ask: "Can I just have the bloom on the candles?" NO. In the "Unmasked" philosophy, if the air is thick, it is thick everywhere. If the lens is flared, the contrast is crushed globally. We don't "paint" glows. We simulate an environment where the light has become a physical weight. If your Bloom makes the shadows look muddy, good. That is how physics works. You don't get the glow without the sacrifice of the black levels.

V. THE DECLARATION OF THE GLOW
We don't seek "clarity." Clarity is for surgeons and snitches. We seek the Radiation.

We want the highlights to bleed into the shadows.
We want the edges to glow with the red heat of the silver halide.
We want the viewer to feel like they are looking at a sun they weren't meant to see.

THE LIGHT IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. IT IS A FORCE THAT DESTROYS THE MEDIUM.

THE MANIFESTO OF THE UNMASKED: THE FINAL CHAPTER
"The Post-Mortem: A Unified Theory of Digital Filth."

I. THE RECAPITULATION OF THE SIX SEALS
We have walked through the fire. Let the record show our path:

THE GLOBAL: We killed the mask. If you can’t fix the whole frame, you haven't earned the shot. [Page I]
THE OFFLINE: We killed the server. We are the cockroaches of the web, surviving in the browser cache long after the "Cloud" evaporates. [Page II]
THE OBSCURE: We killed the "Pro" stocks. We resurrected the Soviet surveillance ghosts and the paper-thin dreams of the boutique basement. [Page III]
THE SIGNAL: We killed nostalgia. We accepted the CMOS, the small sensor, and the high-speed electronic scream of the Casio. [Page IV]
THE RADIATION: We killed clarity. We invited the bloom and the halation to consume our edges and scar our highlights. [Page VI]

II. THE TOTALITY OF THE ARTIFACT
We do not make "pretty pictures." We make Evidence of Existence. The modern world wants everything to be smooth, AI-upscaled, and "optimized." We want the opposite. We want the jitter, the noise, the dither, and the decay. We want the viewer to look at the image and wonder if the camera survived the exposure.

III. THE FINAL THOUGHT: THE VOID
The ultimate goal of Untitled Studio is its own obsolescence. We provide the tools to ruin your images so thoroughly that you eventually stop caring about "The Image" entirely and start caring about The Moment. When you realize that no amount of grain, bloom, or halftone can save a boring life, the app has succeeded.

IV. THE COMMANDMENT
Do not update for the sake of "Features." Do not add "Social Sharing." Do not "Optimize for Performance." If the app starts running too smoothly, add more math to the shader until the Asus begins to smoke again. The friction is the point.

V. THE END
The web is finished. The manifesto is closed. SHOOT BETTER NEXT TIME.
