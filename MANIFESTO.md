THE MANIFESTO OF THE UNMASKED
"Global Adjustments Only. No Hiding. No Lies."

I. THE ATTEMPT
We sought to implement gl_StencilFunc. We tried to bind Framebuffers for "Subject Selection." We wrote 400 lines of shader code to calculate a "Gaussian Blur" for a soft-feathered brush. And what did we get?
>CONTEXT_LOST_WEBGL
>FPS dropped to 4
>The fan on the Acer Aspire sounded like a jet engine taking off from Halim Perdanakusuma.

II. THE REALIZATION
Why did we want masking? To fix mistakes? To brighten a face? To darken a sky? THIS IS DIGICHUD THINKING.
When you shoot a roll of Svema traffic surveillance film, do you get to "mask out" the grain? No. You accept the grain. You breathe the grain.
When you shoot Kodak Aerochrome, do you get to say "I only want the trees to be pink, not the grass"? No. The chemistry does not care about your feelings. The chemistry converts the entire spectrum.

III. THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE GLOBAL
Masking is a digital perversion. It creates a lie. It creates an image that never existed.

"Oh, let me just lift the shadows on my face." COWARDICE.
"Let me saturate just the sunset." WEAKNESS.

True Film Simulation is holistic. It is a chemical bath that drowns the entire image equally. If the shadows are green, they are green everywhere. If the highlights are blown, they are blown forever.
We do not "paint" light. We capture it, we process it, and we suffer the consequences.

IV. THE TECHNICAL LIMITATION AS ART
The Digichuds will say: "Your app sucks, I can't even brush adjustments."
We will say: "The Nvidia 820m prevents us from sinning."
We are not limited by hardware. We are protected by it. The 1GB of VRAM is a guardrail against bad taste.

V. THE DECLARATION
From this day forth, the "Masking Tool" is deprecated. Deleted from the repo. Wiped from the history.

You want to fix your exposure? Shoot better.
You want to change the color of just one object? Buy a paintbrush.
You want "Smart Selection"? Go back to Adobe.

HERE, WE DIE LIKE MEN. WE DIE WITH GLOBAL SATURATION -100. WE DIE WITH THE WHOLE FRAME.
